                    <p>National Service Scheme (NSS) is a program that aims to instil the idea of social welfare in students and to provide service to society without bias. NSS volunteers work to ensure that everyone who is needy gets help to enhance their
                        standard of living and lead a life of dignity. With the goal to work for the betterment of society and instil the spirit of social service among the young students, IIT Jammu established NSS at institute level, headed by Faculty
                        in Charge, IIT Jammu. </p>

                    <p>Currently, IIT Jammu’s active NSS members from different departments are working meticulously for community health care, literacy drives, and environmental protection. Blood donation camps, educative lectures on human values are organized
                        on a regular basis. Spreading happiness through community service is one of the primary objectives of NSS. With innovative activities, we at IIT Jammu are trying to create happy and memorable moments in the lives of other people.
                        The aim of the organization is to produce engineers, who are socially responsible and work for the development of the nation.</p>

                <p>
                    It is an 8 km long hiking path from Mansar lake deer park to the ruins of the Mahur Garh fort. Although the fort is now destroyed and only the gates are remaining but still this trek is overwhelmingly beautiful with all the surrounding valleys and villages.
                    But sometimes, the beauty of this trail gets faded from the litter and garbage spread across it by locals and tourists. On Jan 25th, 2020, NSS IIT Jammu undertook the responsibility to clean this beautiful trek and restore its natural
                    beauty to make it more appealing to tourists. Around 20 students and some faculty members led by Dr Suchismita Roy, covered the entire trek in around 8 hours and also picked the litter spread around. Encouraged by the students, some
                    locals and tourists also helped to pick up the trash.

                    The department of electrical engineering organized a two-day workshop from 15th-16th January, 2020 on “HAM Radio” in collaboration with NSS IIT Jammu. The workshop was addressed by Mr V. K. Arya, Debashish Das, and Mr Vikas Verma, all of them being highly
                    renowned and well-known faces in the HAM world The workshop saw enthusiastic participation, not only from the students and faculty members of IIT Jammu but also from some nearby technical colleges. HAM radio, also known as amateur
                    radio, can be used for communication across short and long distances without internet and cell phone network. They are generally used as a hobby but can also be used for communication during a disaster situation when other means of
                    communication are disrupted. This workshop aimed to teach students how to operate a HAM radio and also to provide knowledge behind its development and communication system.

                <p>
                    The Bakkarwals are a Muslim nomadic tribe based in the Himalayan mountains. They reside in the entire Kashmir region between India and Pakistan and earn a living by rearing goats and sheep. The Bakkarwals migrate across Jammu and Kashmir according to
                    the season. Since they always have to keep moving to keep their family fed, it is difficult for them to get their children to regular schools and also to get earnings. However, since both seasonal and political conditions keep on changing
                    in the area, it is becoming more difficult for them to keep their families safe and fed. This study was conducted by fourth-year B.tech. students, Ms Ishali Kalsi, Ms Sanjana and Mr Kuldip in which they also interviewed some Bakkarwal
                    families.

                    KRITASH, the social welfare club of IIT Jammu organized a workshop on fire safety and First Aid on November 9th, 2019 to promote the importance of disaster management. The workshop was addressed by Mr Sajjan Kumar, ex-fire chief, municipal corporation,
                    New Delhi. He informed the students about fire safety, how to rescue and the do’s and don’ts. Along with the lecture, Mr Sajjan also demonstrated how to rescue people trapped in a fire as well as how to use fire extinguishers.

                    There are around three dogs and four pups living in the IIT Jammu campus. The students residing in the hostel love them a lot and always pet and feed them. Nevertheless, since the winters in the region can be very harsh, the health of the pups was deteriorating
                    and would have inevitably led to their demise if not Mr Aakar and Mr Shubhendra had stepped up. These gentlemen made a dog house so that the pups can sleep there and protect themselves from cold. And now, the pups are always completely
                    safe in their new home.

                    Tanda is among the poorer villages that fall under the Jammu district. The village population mostly consists of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Most of the villagers are engaged in agriculture activities or labourer work. So, NSS IIT Jammu undertook
                    the task of understanding the means of income and the living conditions of the villagers. Around 12 students along with some faculty members went around the village interacting with the villagers and knowing about their living conditions
                    and understanding the problems faced by them ranging from a shortage of water and electricity to shortage of farming area. This survey was conducted on November 7th, 2019. It provided the students with an insight into the problems
                    faced and to help them develop innovative means to cope up with these shortages.

                <p>
                    The birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, father of the nation, not only enlightened the countrymen about the integrity and solidarity of all the people living in the country but also about the importance of cleanliness. Mahatma Gandhi, lovingly known as Bapu,
                    always educated people about keeping their surroundings clean. Following the footsteps of the great leader, students at IIT Jammu took part in a cleanliness campaign called Swacchta Abhiyaan where around fifty students along with faculty
                    members cleaned the crowded and littered Jammu bus stand and railway station. It was a full day exercise by the students, and it helped encourage the nearby people about the importance of cleanliness, and many passengers complimented
                    the students on their effort. NSS IIT Jammu always informs people about the importance of cleanliness and regularly works toward the same.

                    The National Service Scheme(NSS) was incorporated in IIT Jammu’s curriculum in the first semester of 2019 - 2020. Speakers from the NSS units of other renowned technical colleges in the region enlightened the students about the role of NSS in society
                    and how every student can work towards making the world a better place to live. The motto of NSS “Not me But you” give the insight on the working of NSS. All the volunteers pledge to do self-less work for society and also work toward
                    making people self-sufficient and always working towards the betterment of society. Today, IIT Jammu has successfully completed a lot of endeavours that keep on motivating not only the students but also the citizens to give their part
                    in this venture of improving society.
